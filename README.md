# Hello, I'm Arul

## About

I’m Arul, a Computer Science and Engineering student at UCLA. I fell in love with the world of product and entrepreneurship while building side projects for fun.

Outside of work, I enjoy obsessing over consumer technology, psychology, fitness, and minimalism. I'm always interested in meeting new people — reach out if you're up for a chat!
